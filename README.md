## How it's made  🏗
**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [AIC API](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction) <br><br>
This project uses procederal programming to create functions that perform different tasks depending on how the users interacts with the application. Event listeners were attached to different buttons on the programs interface to fetch and display the artworks where appropriate.<br><br>
The main feature of this project lies in its utilization of the Art Institute of Chicago's API. The application handles parsing and validating the data returned from the API and presents it on screen.

## Features 📱
- Present artworks grouped by collection
- Carousel scroll through each art piece individually
- 'More Artworks' button returns random group of art work for viewing pleasure

## Lessons Learned 🎖
- How to familiarize myself with documentation quickly
- Key terms used in making https requests like endpoints, fields, and resources
- Project design and implementation takes planning, testing, and continuous iteration

## Future Improvements 📊
- Reduce delay when fetching specific artwork images (and inforamtion)
- Handle data with no image available
- Add transitions between artworks during scroll
